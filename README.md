# SEARCH-ENGINE-WITH-COMPRESSION-AND-HISTORY
`
This is a search engine project. Initially, we thought to create a smart notepad or text editor project but then we made something that is similar to search engine and the main functionality is to autocomplete the words same as the google search engine but not exactly like the search engine as it is currently in the initial phases.
The features of this project are the following:
1) Auto-complete the words from the given dictionary(which contains different number of words).
2) Create files - The files are created when the user starts typing and the textual data will be saved simultaneouly in .txt file. Files are in append mode i.e. user can continue writing on the prevoius files from where they left.
3) Compression - We used Huffman compression in it which first encodes the file by creating two different .huffman and .table files which contains respective encoding data of the text file and decoded file with "_2" appended in the name which is generated from the 2 encoded files(.huffman and .table)
4) Create History - Almost whatever the user do, it will be saved in the history.txt file.

We Used linkedlist,queue,stack and trie data structure in implementation.
